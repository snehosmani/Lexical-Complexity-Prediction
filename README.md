# Lexical-Complexity-Prediction
This repo is an implementation of Task 1 of SemEval-2021 competition. You can find more info here: https://sites.google.com/view/lcpsharedtask2021

This is supervised ML problem, I have used Stacked RNN's to achieve the goal -> predicting the complexity of a word in a given sentence.

1) Please maintain the folder structure while executing the code. Just upload them to the same directory where the code resides.
2) All the files should be in the same directory, I have not created any separate folders for data or the models that were generated.
3) I have provided both colab and py files.
4) If you are running the py files, kindly install the requirements in your system via the terminal by running the below command.
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` , and only then execute the py file, else you might run into some dependency errors. 
5) I have used all the latest packages and hence not mentioned the version name in the requirements file.
6) I have two model parameters - Stack_RNN.h5 and Tuned_Stack_RNN.h5
